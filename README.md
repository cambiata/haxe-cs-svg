## OSX

Make sure that you have [mono](http://www.mono-project.com/download/#download-mac) installed. 

Typically, the mono installpath should be ```/Library/Frameworks/Mono.framework/```.
The mono compiler (mcs) should be found at ```/Library/Frameworks/Mono.framework/Versions/Current/bin/mcs```

The referenced libraries used in this example (System.Drawing.dll and System.Xml.dll) should be found at the following paths:

* /Library/Frameworks/Mono.framework/Libraries/mono/4.0/System.Drawing.dll
* /Library/Frameworks/Mono.framework/Libraries/mono/4.0/System.Xml.dll
